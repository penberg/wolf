# Wolf

Wolf is a raycasting engine for 2.5D games, like Wolfenstein 3D and others from
the 1990s!

The engine uses OpenGL for rendering with GPUs but operates on 2D maps under
the hood.  The player is is thus not able to move up or down and walls always
have 90-degree angles between them.

The design of the engine is similar to the [iPhone port of Wolfenstein 3D](http://fabiensanglard.net/wolf3d/index.php).
